# ðŸ“¦ obuild ðŸ˜¯

âœ… Zero-config ESM/TS package builder.

Powered by [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/), [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) and [**rolldown-plugin-dts**](https://github.com/sxzz/rolldown-plugin-dts).

The **obuild** project aims to be the next-generation successor to current [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild).

- ðŸŒ± Fresh rewrite with cleanups and removal of legacy features.
- ðŸš€ Uses [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/) and [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) instead of rollup and mkdist.
- ðŸ‘Œ Strict ESM-compliant imports with explicit extensions.
- ðŸ”’ Types are build with isolated declaration constraints.
- ðŸª¦ No support for CommonJS output.

Some differences are not easy to adopt. Developing as a standalone project allows faster progress and dogfooding in real projects.

### Currently used by

- ðŸ“¦ [obuild](https://github.com/unjs/obuild/) itself
