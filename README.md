# 📦 obuild 😯

✅ Zero-config ESM/TS package builder.

Powered by [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/), [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) and [**rolldown-plugin-dts**](https://github.com/sxzz/rolldown-plugin-dts).

The **obuild** project aims to be the next-generation successor to current [unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild).

- 🌱 Fresh rewrite with cleanups and removal of legacy features.
- 🚀 Uses [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/) and [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) instead of rollup and mkdist.
- 👌 Strict ESM-compliant imports with explicit extensions.
- 🔒 Types are build with isolated declaration constraints.
- 🪦 No support for CommonJS output.

Some differences are not easy to adopt. Developing as a standalone project allows faster progress and dogfooding in real projects.

## Usage

```sh
# bundle
npx obuild ./src.index.ts

# transform
npx obuild ./src/runtime/:./dist/runtime
```

You can use `--dir` to set working directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Auto inference similar to unbuild coming soon ([#4](https://github.com/unjs/obuild/issues/4)).
